## Personal Data Exchange

The personal data exchange is an interface that allows the user to save and control access to their basic personal information such as name, phone number, email, date of birth etc. The user can upload their information, retrieve the uploaded information, and grant access to other users. This application is built using React, Material-UI and the [Linnia Protocol](https://github.com/ConsenSys/linnia-js).
